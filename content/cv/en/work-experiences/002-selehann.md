As a Mobile & Frontend Developer at Selehann, I am actively involved in the development of a product for our client, Nerdrabbit. Our team is continuously working on enhancing and refining the product to meet the client's requirements and expectations.

My responsibilities include:

- Collaborating on both platforms: I contribute to the development efforts on both the web and mobile platforms for the Nerdly product. However, I currently lead the development efforts specifically for the mobile app.

- Leadership on Mobile App: As the leader of the mobile app development team, I provide guidance, direction, and technical expertise to ensure the successful implementation of features and functionalities. I oversee the development process, coordinate tasks, and ensure alignment with project goals and timelines.

- Tech Stack: We utilize React Native and Redux Toolkit for the Nerdly Mobile App, leveraging the efficiency and flexibility of these technologies to create a seamless and intuitive user experience. Additionally, I collaborate with the team working on the Nerdly Web App, which is built using Angular.

My role as a Mobile & Frontend Developer at Selehann allows me to leverage my expertise in both frontend engineering and mobile development to contribute effectively to the success of the Nerdly product and exceed our client's expectations.
