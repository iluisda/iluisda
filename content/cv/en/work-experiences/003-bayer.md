As a Frontend Engineer at Bayer/Monsanto, I played a crucial role in the maintenance and continuous development of the Cereal Track Monsanto platform. This platform, integrated within Bayer Crop Science and built using Angular, was essential for crop tracking and management.

My responsibilities included:

- Platform maintenance: I performed regular updates, bug fixes, and enhancements to the platform to ensure its optimal performance and user satisfaction.

- Development of new features: I closely collaborated with cross-functional teams to design and implement new features and improvements that increased platform efficiency and usability.

- Performance optimization: I conducted performance testing and code optimization to ensure fast loading times and a seamless experience for users.

- Interdepartmental collaboration: I maintained open communication with other teams, including backend developers, designers, and business analysts, to ensure consistency and effective integration of the platform throughout the Bayer/Monsanto ecosystem.

My work at Bayer/Monsanto as a Frontend Engineer on the Cereal Track Monsanto platform allowed me to contribute to the company's ongoing success in modern agriculture and efficient crop management.
