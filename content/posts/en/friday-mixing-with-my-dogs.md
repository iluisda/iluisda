excerpt: After a difficult morning struggling with GitHub, I relax in the afternoon mixing some nice house music with my dogs.

Today, I spent the afternoon mixing some house music after tidying up branches on GitHub and recovering code from other branches that belonged to integration features by other colleagues at work. I took advantage of the afternoon as it's my hobby and I had new music to mix. I had listened to a couple of songs on Spotify from which I got the idea to make a mix and upload it to the SoundCloud platform. I immersed myself in pulsating rhythms and enveloping melodies while letting my creativity flow through the mixing desk controls.

With each smooth transition and every change of rhythm, I felt the music come to life and transport my mind to a state of pure euphoria. The mixing process was not only an opportunity to experiment with new sounds but also to disconnect from work and relax in the company of my faithful furry friends who were by my side, enjoying the music as much as I was. Finally, when I uploaded my mix to SoundCloud, I felt immense satisfaction in sharing my passion with the world and hoping that others will also find joy and energy in the rhythms I created with such care.
