excerpt: After a difficult morning struggling with GitHub, I relax in the afternoon mixing some nice house music with my dogs.

Today, I spent the afternoon mixing some house music after tidying up branches on GitHub and recovering code from other branches that belonged to integration features by other colleagues at work. I took advantage of the afternoon as it's my hobby and I had new music to mix. One of the tools that has been incredibly helpful for me in this journey is the djay app by Algoriddim. This intuitive app has provided me with a platform to hone my mixing skills and explore the art of DJing.

As an amateur mixer, the djay app has been instrumental in my learning process, offering a range of features and functionalities that have enabled me to create seamless transitions and captivating mixes. Additionally, I use my Hercules DJControl Control MIX Bluetooth MIDI controller to control the software, allowing me to have a tactile experience and better express my creativity.

I had listened to a couple of songs on Spotify from which I got the idea to make a mix and upload it to the SoundCloud platform. I immersed myself in pulsating rhythms and enveloping melodies while letting my creativity flow through the mixing desk controls. 

With each smooth transition and every change of rhythm, I felt the music come to life and transport my mind to a state of pure euphoria. The mixing process was not only an opportunity to experiment with new sounds but also to disconnect from work and relax in the company of my faithful furry friends who were by my side, enjoying the music as much as I was. Finally, when I uploaded my mix to SoundCloud, I felt immense satisfaction in sharing my passion with the world and hoping that others will also find joy and energy in the rhythms I created with such care.

If you want to take a stroll through my SoundCloud profile, here's the link to the track I mixed. Feel free to give it a listen :) *[Sexta-feira 14hs ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ§](https://soundcloud.com/iluisdamusic/sexta-feira-14hs?si=37fd9f20da9b43e08bb34c8c69925349&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)*.
